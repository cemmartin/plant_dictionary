<h1>Plant Dictionary ðŸŒ±</h1>
I developed this Plant Dictionary using an Perenual's free API! The app teaches the user about a wide variety of plants, displaying to the user information such as the scientific name and watering preferences of a given plant. Users are also able to favourite their preferred plants and remove them from their favourites list.


To run this application: 

Get an API key from https://perenual.com/docs/api

After cloning this application and adding the API key, run the following commands in your terminal:
npm i
npm run dev
